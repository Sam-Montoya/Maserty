        <h1>You can make your own elements that are specific to what you need them to do. You can give them their own properties,
            functionality, and styling. Custom elements use the HTMLUnkownElement rather than the HTMLElement interface,
            which allows each element to have it's own API! You can also make your own custom elements that extend off of
            existing ones. However, Custom Elements are still newer concepts, and aren't quite yet ready for production.

        <h1>The Semantic Web is a common data format for exchanging, supposedly making things easier.</h1>
        <h1>Some of the goals are to make it cost effective for people to record information, as well as the mixing of diverse
            metadata.</h1>
        <h1>The purpose is to use HTML to inforce the web semantics information rather than the look of the webpage.</h1>
        <h1>Best Practices are to get feedback and follow the Web Semantic.</h1>
        <h1>Doctype gets the version of the language of the page that it's written in. (DTD) It will also know what type of document
            it is.</h1>
        <h1>Datatypes in databases can change the amount of space it takes up. You wouldn't want people being able to spam the
            database with tons of characters. This will make the load time of the database much much slower, due to the non-limited
            data type. Another example is if you wanted to store an object's ID in the database. You wouldn't want to have
            it be a string if the ID is all numbers! Or if a serial number contains letters and numbers, but is only 10 characters
            long, you could limit the amount of characters so space doesn't get wasted, along with long load times.
